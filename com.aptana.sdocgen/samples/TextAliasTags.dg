/**
 * Remove items from an array that do not pass a given criteria. Each item in
 * the specified array will be passed to the filtering function. If that
 * function returns true, then the item will be appended to the resulting array.
 * If the function returns false, the item is not added to the resulting array.
 * 
 * Note that the specified array is not altered in place. A new array is created
 * as a result of this function call.
 * 
 * @alias Package1.Package2.methodName
 * @param {Array} array
 * 		The source array to be filtered
 * @param {Function} func
 * 		The filtering function to apply to each array item. This filter has two
 * 		parameters. The first parameter is the current item in the array that is
 *		potentially being filtered. The second parameter is the index of the
 *		item potentially being filtered. The index can be used in cases where
 *		the filtering decision needs to be determined based on proximity to
 *		other items in the array
