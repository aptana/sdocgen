Currently, this directory contains files that were used as sanity tests when
sdocgen was first being developed. Eventually, these will be turned into
full-blown unit tests, but for now they can at least serve as examples of the
supported sdoc syntax. The scripts provided here are very minimal (no error
checking, for example). An example of how you might use them follows:

prompt> create_xml.sh ConstructorSample.dg > constructor.xml
prompt> create_docs constructor.xml

This will process the ConstructorSample.dg file and generate an XML file from
it. The XML is then processed into HTML documents which will be contained
within a constructor.xml_docs folder.
